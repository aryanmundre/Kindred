- When possible, try to reuse or refactor existing functionality rather than adding new code
- Never introduce a new technology without asking first. (e.g., changing from react to angular)
- Make the minimal set of changes to achieve intended prompt
- Always validate & sanitize on server; escape output.
- Keep secrets server-side only (env vars, ensure .env is in .gitignore).
- Server must verify permissions for every action & resource.
- Generic error messages for users; detailed logs for devs.
- Server must confirm current user owns/can access the specific resource ID.
- Define data access rules directly in your database (e.g., RLS).
- Rate limit APIs (middleware); encrypt sensitive data at rest; always use HTTPS.
